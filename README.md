> The goal of this project aligns with the intention of creating a resume database that expresses a project team that will be under the wonderful guidance of a world famous sensei. The database contains information about the various people that make up the project team, the skills that they possess, and the roles that they currently have in the company. The database will be able to be queried in order to provide information about the people, skills, and roles that ultimately make up the company's workforce.
